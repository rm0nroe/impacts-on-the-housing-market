### How to view the visualization
Our website utilizes D3 and the Google Maps API.  In order for the visualization portion of our website to render from a local server you will need to include a Google Maps Javascript API Key.  You can register for an API key for your Google account here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
Alternatively, if you do not want to sign up for an API key for any reason you can still render the visualization locally using this string ("//maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true") in place of the API key string in the phoenix.html file.
