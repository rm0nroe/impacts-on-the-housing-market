Filter description on d3

For the variables below:
Bathrooms,Bedrooms,	Home Size, Year Built, count_yelp, count_school

1) Scale these columns by using (x - x.min())/(x_max-x_min)
2) Create a toggle for each of them with preference choices '1(least important) - 6(most important)', which will be used as 'weight'.
   Then the size of each dot on the map = weight * scaled variables.
