   "Using multivariate statistical analysis techniques such as Principal Component Analysis,
    Factor Analysis, and Discriminant Analysis, we determine the factors having the most eect on housing
    markets. We also discover which of the 50 US states' housing markets are likely to provide a stable or risky
    investment for those wishing to dabble in real estate."
    This paper uses thirteen variables and statistical modeling methods such as PCA and factor analysis to classify the house market of 50     states into 'Risky' or 'Stable'. However, 'risky' and 'stable' are relative in the analysis. Note that the paper was written in 2008,     it may have some limitations due to the specific economic environment.

    This paper investigates whether the magnet schools may boost the house price of neighborhood. The discussion is only limited to           Chicago though. We can conduct similar analysis to other major cities to see if 'magnet school' can be used as an indicator of house       prices.
