1. (Zach) Edward L. Glaeser, Hyunjin Kim, Michael Luca. "Measuring Gentrification:Using YELP Data to Quantify Neighborhood Change", 2018

   By incorporating yelp data and multiple house price data sources including zillow, this paper illustrate how the local business landscape correlates with measures of neighborhood gentrification. As an important indicator of gentrification, house price is strongly correlated with the increase of multiple Yelp establishments as well. The authors found that "the presence of a Starbucks is far less important than whether the community has people who consume Starbucks".  The number of Yelp reviews were used as a proxy for business activity in this paper, and will probably prove a good feature in our model as well.

   "Using multivariate statistical analysis techniques such as Principal Component Analysis,
    Factor Analysis, and Discriminant Analysis, we determine the factors having the most eect on housing
    markets. We also discover which of the 50 US states' housing markets are likely to provide a stable or risky
    investment for those wishing to dabble in real estate."
    This paper uses thirteen variables and statistical modeling methods such as PCA and factor analysis to classify the house market of 50     states into 'Risky' or 'Stable'. However, 'risky' and 'stable' are relative in the analysis. Note that the paper was written in 2008,     it may have some limitations due to the specific economic environment. 
   
3. (Zach) Chad Evans and Joel R. Malin. "The Relationship Between Magnet Status and and Neighborhood Home Values in Chicago", 2017

    This paper investigates whether the magnet schools may boost the house price of neighborhood. The discussion is only limited to           Chicago though. We can conduct similar analysis to other major cities to see if 'magnet school' can be used as an indicator of           house prices. The authors found that neighborhoods with traditional magnet schools and magnet clusters have a higher median home          value.  One limitation with this paper is it is hard to determine if the magnet schools caused the increase in home value or if          magnet schools tend to be built in better neighborhoods.

10. (James) Meucci, Attilio, Factors on Demand: Building a Platform for Portfolio Managers, Risk Managers and Traders, 2010

     This paper contains a summary of methods used for generalized asset price factor contribution estimation. These methods vary from           simple to state of the art.  The paper empshises point in time estimation,  which is critical for our cross sectional analysis           house prices.

      This paper describes a method for measuring the perceived safety of a street using google street view images and Support Vector           Regression.  Streetscore was used by Glaseser, et al (2018) as an outcome variable to in their attempt to measure gentrification          of a neighborhood.  We could use Streetscore as an input variable in our model as part of a safety component to home value.
   
13. (Ryan) Jonathan A. Wiley. "The Impact of Commercial Development on Surrounding Residential Property Values", 2015 
      
      This paper studies how industrial, commercial, and retail development affect housing prices within a specified radius in Atlanta. Pre-development completion, immediate completion, and post-development completion price metrics are recorded and analyzed on their appreciation/deprecation as a result of the development lifecycle. The paper outlines that retail developments being introduced to surrounding residential properties yields a positive effect on the local residential pricing, which is directly applicable to our analysis on how amenities influence house prices.
The shortcoming of this paper is around the findings of the effect of commercial development; it was found to have an insignificant effect on surrounding residential prices which is contrary to many arguments.

17. (Ryan) Ivor Samuels. “What Home Buyers Want”, 2004.

   This paper steps through the most important aspects of buying a home from a consumers stand point. Through a collection of surveys, this report was published to outline the desires & priority of such when a consumer is considering buying a home. This information is invaluable to our project when identifying the most important features to be included when performing a home search. The shortcoming of this paper would be the sample pool of data is for home buyers in England, as opposed to in America. This can be cross sectioned with our existing research in the States to make an accurate determinant.
   
18. (Ryan) Jessica Lautz, Meredith Dunn, Brandi Snowden, Amanda Riggs, and Brian Horowitz. “Home Buyer and Seller Generational Trend Report”, 2017

   This paper outlines the characteristics of home buyers along with the characteristics of the home being purchased since 2013. The data provided can be useful for our project for identifying the most influential characteristics in buying a home - neighborhood quality, school quality/distance, shopping convienence, airport locality, etc. With this, comes visualizations as well. The shortcoming of this document is the abstraction of data — it is highly generalized(what is their definition of a ‘good’ neighborhood). For our project, we will mitigate this by the use of a focused area/region.
