===Description===
We combine data from multiple sources including Zillow, Yelp, Great Schools, and public records and created an interactive software tool to help home buyers find their ideal home. The underlying statistical model of our visualization has accurately predicted over 80% of the house values in our dataset and will provide a customizable and reliable estimation of the budget according to the customerâ€™s preferences.

You can download this package and run it based on the instructions below without installing any additional dependencies.  However, optionally you may sign up for a Google Maps API key here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
Signing up for and placing your key in the Index.html file will allow you to remove the "For Development Purposes Only" watermark on the map visualization.  To do this replace the string: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true with https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=[YOUR API KEY HERE] in row 168 of the Index.html file.
